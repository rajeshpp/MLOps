# MLOps Project Life Cycle

MLOps Project has a Life Cycle which needs to be followed to have an effective business results. In this section we are going to discuss on several phases/stages involved in the MLOps Project Life Cycle.

The stages of MLOps Project Life Cycle are:
- Business Understanding
- Data Understanding
- Data Preparation
- Modeling
- Model Evaluation
- Model Deployment
- Model Consumption
- Continuous Evaluation

Now we are going to discuss on these topics in detail below. Follow us along.

## Business Understanding
- Once we have a business problem, Data Scientists & Machine Learning Engineers will start the actual work.
- The DS/ML Engineer should gain understanding of available data by discussing with Business decision-maker or product owner.

## Data Understanding
- Collect & Process all the relevant data into one place.
- Analyze the data in such a way that 
  - If the question can be answered with the existing data.
  - If the business problem can be solved with the existing data or some extra data is needed?
  - Data is of good quality without the missing values, outliers etc
- Have a continuous discussion with business stakeholders to have good quality of data and good quality of model further down the line.

## Data Preparation

- Most time consuming task.
- Data preparation is needed for encoding categorical or factor variables as numerical.
### Dependent Variable Preparation
- These variables are used to predict using past data.
- Business decision can be taken based on these predictions.
- Without having clear dependent variable, we cannot move forward with the ML use case.
- This is the first and important step after business understanding.
- The data quantification happens in this step.

### Feature Engineering
- Process of deriving useful features from data set. This enables to predict dependent variables.
- To attain this, creativity and domain/business understanding are required.
- 
### Independent variables
### Feature Selection
