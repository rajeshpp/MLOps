The stages of MLOps Project Life Cycle are:
- Business Understanding
- Data Understanding
- Data Preparation
- Modeling
- Model Evaluation
- Model Deployment
- Model Consumption
- Continuous Evaluation

Now we are going to discuss on these topics in detail below. Follow us along.

## Business Understanding
- Once we have a business problem, Data Scientists & Machine Learning Engineers will start the actual work.
- The DS/ML Engineer should gain understanding of available data by discussing with Business decision-maker or product owner.

## Data Understanding
- Collect & Process all the relevant data into one place.
- Analyze the data in such a way that 
  - If the question can be answered with the existing data.
  - If the business problem can be solved with the existing data or some extra data is needed?
  - Data is of good quality without the missing values, outliers etc
- Have a continuous discussion with business stakeholders to have good quality of data and good quality of model further down the line.

## Data Preparation
- Most time consuming task.
- Feature Engineering is needed. Dependent Variables & Independent Variables separation.
