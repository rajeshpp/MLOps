# Model Drift

Model performance on a longer run (sometimes very quickly) gets deteriorated due to the changes in the data and relationships between input and output variables.

There are certain ways that can be followed to detect and mitigate drift:
- Monitor and manage model performance.
- Continuous tracking of metrics such as accuracy and consistency and alert if there is a drift.
- Automate drift monitoring and minimize model degradation.
- Track targets through development, validation and deployment.
